Description: An algorithm for flexible conditional density estimation based on
    application of pooled hazard regression to an artificial repeated measures
    dataset constructed by discretizing the support of the outcome variable. To
    facilitate non/semi-parametric estimation of the conditional density, the
    highly adaptive lasso, a nonparametric regression function shown to reliably
    estimate a large class of functions at a provably fast convergence rate with
    only mild assumptions, is utilized. The pooled hazards data augmentation
    formulation implemented was first described by DÃ­az and van der Laan (2011)
    <doi:10.2202/1557-4679.1356>.

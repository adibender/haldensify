Description: Conditional density estimation is a longstanding and challenging
    problem in statistical theory, and numerous proposals exist for optimally
    estimating such complex functions. An algorithm for nonparametric estimation
    of conditional densities based on a pooled hazard regression formulation is
    implemented based on the highly adaptive lasso (HAL), an optimal algorithm
    for efficient estimation guaranteeing fast convergence rates.

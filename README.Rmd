## What's `haldensify`?

The `haldensify` R package is designed to provide facilities for nonparametric
conditional density estimation based on a flexible procedure proposed initially
by @diaz2011super. The core of the implemented methodology involves recovering
conditional density estimates by performing pooled hazards regressions so as to
assess the conditional hazard that an observed value falls in a given bin over
the (conditional) support of the variable of interest. Such conditional density
estimates are useful, for example, in causal inference problems in which the
_generalized propensity score_ (for continuous-valued exposures) must be
estimated [@diaz2012population; @diaz2018stochastic; @diaz2020causal].
`haldensify` implements this conditional density estimation strategy for use
only with the highly adaptive lasso (HAL) [@benkeser2016highly;
@vdl2017generally; @vdl2018highly; @coyle2020hal9001-rpkg;
@hejazi2020hal9001-joss]. As the (generalized) propensity score is the primary
ingredient in inverse probability weighted (IPW) methods, `haldensify` builds
loosely on the advances of @ertefaie2021nonparametric to provide nonparametric
IPW estimators of the causal effects of continuous treatments
[@hejazi2021efficient], which can be made to achieve the non/semi-parametric
efficiency bound by undersmoothing over a family of the HAL conditional density
estimators.

## Installation

For standard use, we recommend installing the package from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=haldensify) via

```{r cran-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("haldensify")
```

To contribute, install the _development version_ of `haldensify` from GitHub
via [`remotes`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=remotes):

```{r gh-master-installation, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("nhejazi/haldensify")
```

## Example

A simple example illustrates how `haldensify` may be used to train a highly
adaptive lasso model to obtain conditional density estimates:

```{r example-fit}
library(haldensify)
set.seed(76924)

# simulate data: W ~ U[-4, 4] and A|W ~ N(mu = W, sd = 0.25)
n_train <- 100
w <- runif(n_train, -4, 4)
a <- rnorm(n_train, w, 0.25)

# HAL-based density estimate of A|W
haldensify_fit <- haldensify(
  A = a, W = w,
  n_bins = 10, grid_type = "equal_range",
  lambda_seq = exp(seq(-1, -10, length = 100)),
  # arguments passed to hal9001::fit_hal()
  max_degree = 3,
  reduce_basis = 1 / sqrt(n_train)
)
haldensify_fit
```

We can also visualize the empirical risk (with respect to density loss) in terms
of the solution path of the lasso regularization parameter:
```{r example-plot, out.width = "80%"}
# just use the built-in plot method
plot(haldensify_fit)
```

Finally, we can obtain conditional density estimates from the trained model on
the training (or on new) data:
```{r example-predict}
# use the built-in predict method to get predictions
pred_haldensify <- predict(haldensify_fit, new_A = a, new_W = w)
head(pred_haldensify)
```

vignette](https://code.nimahejazi.org/haldensify/articles/intro_haldensify) on
the corresponding `pkgdown` site.

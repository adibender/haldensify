## What's `haldensify`?

The `haldensify` R package is designed to provide facilities for nonparametric
conditional density estimation based on a flexible procedure proposed initially
by @diaz2011super. The core of the implemented methodology involves recovering
conditional density estimates by performing pooled hazards regressions so as to
assess the conditional hazard that an observed value falls in a given bin over
the (conditional) support of the variable of interest. Such conditional density
estimates are useful, for example, in causal inference problems in which the
_generalized propensity score_ (for continuous-valued exposures) must be
estimated [@diaz2012population; @diaz2018stochastic; @diaz2020causal].
`haldensify` implements this condtional density estimation strategy
specifically for use only with the highly adaptive lasso [@benkeser2016highly;
@vdl2017generally; @vdl2018highly; @coyle2019hal9001].

## Installation

For standard use, we recommend installing the package from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=haldensify) via

```{r cran-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("haldensify")
```

To contribute, install the _development version_ of `haldensify` from GitHub
via [`remotes`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=remotes):

```{r gh-master-installation, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("nhejazi/haldensify")
```

---

## Example

A simple example illustrates how `haldensify` may be used to construct
conditional density estimates:

```{r example, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(data.table)
library(haldensify)
set.seed(76924)

# simulate data: W ~ U[-4, 4] and A|W ~ N(mu = W, sd = 0.5)
n_train <- 100
w <- runif(n_train, -4, 4)
a <- rnorm(n_train, w, 0.5)

# learn relationship A|W using HAL-based density estimation procedure
mod_haldensify <- haldensify(
  A = a, W = w,
  n_bins = c(10, 20),
  grid_type = c("equal_range", "equal_mass"),
  lambda_seq = exp(seq(-1, -10, length = 300))
)

# predictions to recover conditional density of A|W
new_a <- seq(-4, 4, by = 0.1)
new_w_neg <- rep(-2, length(new_a))
new_w_zero <- rep(0, length(new_a))
new_w_pos <- rep(2, length(new_a))
new_dat <- as.data.table(list(a = new_a, w_neg = new_w_neg,
                              w_null = new_w_zero, w_pos = new_w_pos))
new_dat$pred_w_neg <- predict(mod_haldensify,
                              new_A = new_dat$a, new_W = new_dat$w_neg)
new_dat$pred_w_null <- predict(mod_haldensify,
                               new_A = new_dat$a, new_W = new_dat$w_null)
new_dat$pred_w_pos <- predict(mod_haldensify,
                              new_A = new_dat$a, new_W = new_dat$w_pos)

# visualize results
p <- new_dat %>%
  melt(id = c("a"), measure.vars =
       c("pred_w_pos", "pred_w_null", "pred_w_neg")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = a, y = value, colour = variable)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = -2, sd = 0.5),
                colour = "blue", linetype = "dashed") +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 0.5),
                colour = "darkgreen", linetype = "dashed") +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 2, sd = 0.5),
                colour = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  xlab("Observed value") +
  ylab("Predicted probability") +
  ggtitle("Conditional density p(A|W)") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
p %>% print()
```

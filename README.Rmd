> Nonparametric Conditional Density Estimation with the Highly Adaptive Lasso

__Author:__ [Nima Hejazi](https://nimahejazi.org)

## What's `haldensify`?

The `haldensify` R package is designed to provide facilities for nonparametric
conditional density estimation based on the procedure proposed by
@diaz2011super. The core of the implemented methodology involves recovering
conditional density estimates by performing pooled hazards regressions so as to
assess the conditional hazard that an observation falls in a given bin over the
support of the variable of interest. Such conditional density estimates are
required to estimate the propensity score when the intervention variable
considered is continuous [@diaz2012population, @diaz2018stochastic,
@diaz2019causal]. Though future generalization of the core routines may be
possible, for the time being, `haldensify` is a minimal implementation of this
strategy for use only with the highly adaptive lasso [@benkeser2016highly,
@vdl2017generally, @vdl2018highly, @coyle2018hal9001].

## Installation

Install the most recent _stable release_ from GitHub via
[`devtools`](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools/):

```{r gh-master-installation, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("nhejazi/haldensify")
```

---

## Example

A simple example illustrates how `haldensify` may be used to construct
conditional density estimates:

```{r example, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
library(data.table)
library(tidyverse)
library(hal9001)

# simulate data: W ~ Rademacher and A|W ~ N(mu = \pm 1, sd = 0.5)
n_train <- 1000
w <- rbinom(n_train, 1, 0.5)
w[w == 0] <- -1
a <- rnorm(n_train, w, 0.5)

# learn relationship A|W using HAL-based density estimation procedure
mod_haldensify <- haldensify(
  A = a, W = w,
  grid_type = "equal_range",
  n_bins = 10,
  lambda_seq = exp(seq(-1, -13, length = 1000))
)

# predictions to recover conditional density of A|W
new_a <- seq(-2, 2, by = 0.1)
new_w_neg <- rep(-1, length(new_a))
new_w_pos <- rep(1, length(new_a))
pred_haldensify_neg_mean <- predict(mod_haldensify,
                                    new_A = new_a, new_W = new_w_neg)
pred_haldensify_pos_mean <- predict(mod_haldensify,
                                    new_A = new_a, new_W = new_w_pos)

# organize data for visualization
plot(x = new_a, y = pred_haldensify_neg_mean, type = "l")
lines(x = new_a, y = pred_haldensify_pos_mean)
```

> Nonparametric Conditional Density Estimation with the Highly Adaptive Lasso

__Author:__ [Nima Hejazi](https://nimahejazi.org)

---

## What's `haldensify`?

The `haldensify` R package is designed to provide facilities for nonparametric
conditional density estimation based on the procedure proposed by
@diaz2011super. The core procedure involves recovering conditional density
estimates by performing pooled hazards regressions on a long format data set
built from the input data. For the time being, `haldensify` is a minimal
implementation of this density estimation strategy, though future generalization
of the core routines may be possible.

---

## Installation

Install the most recent _stable release_ from GitHub via
[`devtools`](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools/):

```{r gh-master-installation, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("nhejazi/haldensify", build_vignettes = FALSE)
```

---

## Example

A simple example illustrates how `haldensify` may be used to construct
conditional density estimates:

```{r example, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
```

* [R/`condensier`](https://github.com/osofr/condensier) - An  independent
  implementation of the same core methodology, though more general in its making
  allowance for arbitrary selection of regression functions and a greater
  variety of hazard regression strategies.

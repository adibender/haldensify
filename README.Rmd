## What's `haldensify`?

The `haldensify` R package is designed to provide facilities for nonparametric
conditional density estimation based on a flexible procedure proposed initially
by @diaz2011super. The core of the implemented methodology involves recovering
conditional density estimates by performing pooled hazards regressions so as to
assess the conditional hazard that an observed value falls in a given bin over
the (conditional) support of the variable of interest. Such conditional density
estimates are useful, for example, in causal inference problems in which the
_generalized propensity score_ (for continuous-valued exposures) must be
estimated [@diaz2012population; @diaz2018stochastic; @diaz2020causal].
`haldensify` implements this condtional density estimation strategy
specifically for use only with the highly adaptive lasso [@benkeser2016highly;
@vdl2017generally; @vdl2018highly; @coyle2019hal9001].

## Installation

For standard use, we recommend installing the package from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=haldensify) via

```{r cran-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("haldensify")
```

To contribute, install the _development version_ of `haldensify` from GitHub
via [`remotes`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=remotes):

```{r gh-master-installation, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("nhejazi/haldensify")
```

---

## Example

A simple example illustrates how `haldensify` may be used to construct
conditional density estimates:

```{r example, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(data.table)
library(haldensify)
set.seed(76924)

# simulate data: W ~ U[-4, 4] and A|W ~ N(mu = W, sd = 0.25)
n_train <- 50
w <- runif(n_train, -4, 4)
a <- rnorm(n_train, w, 0.25)

# HAL-based density estimate of A|W
mod_haldensify <- haldensify(
  A = a, W = w,
  n_bins = c(5, 20),
  grid_type = "equal_range",
  lambda_seq = exp(seq(-1, -10, length = 100))
)

# use the built-in predict method to get predictions
pred_haldensify <- predict(mod_haldensify, new_A = a, new_W = w)
```
